Customer Segmentation
This project was completed during my Data Science internship at Infotact Solutions. It focuses on identifying distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The insights gained from this segmentation can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

📌 Project Objective
To apply clustering algorithms on customer data to segment them into distinct groups based on their behavior, preferences, and demographics.

🧠 Techniques Used
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Scaling & Normalization

K-Means Clustering

Elbow Method & Silhouette Score

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for visualization

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

📁 Dataset
The dataset used contains customer information such as:

Age

Annual Income

Spending Score

Gender

...and more depending on the specific dataset provided by the internship

(Note: Due to privacy policies, the actual dataset used may not be publicly available.)

🔍 Key Findings
Identified distinct customer segments (e.g., high income–low spending, low income–high spending, etc.)

Helped visualize clusters using PCA and scatter plots

Insights can assist in targeted marketing strategies and customer relationship management

📊 Visualizations
Distribution of features

Cluster plots

Elbow and Silhouette plots for optimal K

🧾 Conclusion
Customer segmentation is a powerful technique that enables companies to better understand their customer base and develop more personalized marketing campaigns. This project showcases how machine learning can be applied to gain actionable insights from customer data.

🚀 Future Work
Integrate demographic features for deeper segmentation

Explore other clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)

Apply segmentation to real-time or streaming customer data
